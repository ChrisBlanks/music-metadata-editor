# music-metadata-editor project

The goal of this project was to create a GUI application for converting music files and
editing flac metadata. The Kivy API was used for creating the GUI. Several CLI programs
were used in order to convert file types (e.g. .wav to .flac) and set metadata.

*Currently, there's only a demo for this application, which has basic functionality and a bare bones UI.*
